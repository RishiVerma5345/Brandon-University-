        <h1>Brandon University moves to Phase Grey in campus re-opening</h1><br>
<br><br><br>

        <p>Brandon University is cautiously moving to the mid-range Phase Grey in its phased campus 
            re-opening plan, as declining case counts, high vaccination rates, and enhanced campus 
            preparation increase the university’s optimism for the Fall Term.<br><br>

            “This is a time of transition as we get ready for a partial return to in-person instruction 
            this fall,” said BU President David Docherty, who announced the coming phase change during 
            Monday’s General Faculty Council. “I thank everyone at Brandon University who has worked so 
            hard, under such trying circumstances, and ensured we are in a position to safely host more 
            on-campus activity.”<br><br>
            
            Phase Grey is the middle phase in BU’s reopening plan, between the more restrictive Phase
             Blue, and the more open Phase Gold. All phases are broad and designed to be adjusted and 
             tweaked as circumstances changes. While BU has been in Phase Blue for the entire pandemic
              so far, its effects have ‘lightened’ over time, and an increasing number of employees 
              have returned to on-campus work, at least some of the time. Lightening of Phase Blue 
              has been supported through actions like mask mandates and vaccinations, as well as 
              campus enhancements like improved ventilation and barriers.<br><br>
            
            Similarly, Phase Grey will start in a ‘dark grey’ mode. This means immediate changes will 
            be modest. Starting now, all faculty and staff will have full key-fob access to every 
            building on campus, expanding from just their areas. And University-related travel will 
            once again be approved, so long as it follows public-health guidance and other restrictions.
             In general, that means travellers must be fully-vaccinated with two weeks past their second
              dose, or must follow strict self-isolation or quarantine requirements, depending on their
               destination.<br><br>
            
            At this time, flexible work arrangements and public health guidance still permit many 
            employees to work from home, if they are able. Specific work arrangements are determined 
            with supervisors and with HR. However, the university encourages everyone to begin 
            occasional returns to the campus, so everyone can familiarize themselves with changes on 
            campus, as well as to ensure that their workspaces are appropriately prepared for a future 
            full-time return.<br><br>
            
            The BU Physical Plant has already conducted walk-throughs of the entire campus with Deans 
            and Directors to assess and install Covid-safe requirements. Any additional needs should 
            be communicated to your Dean or your supervisor to liaise with Physical Plant.<br><br>
            
            “We have made tremendous investments on our campus, with new signage, barriers, 
            sanitization stations, ventilation and air filtration improvements, as well as a mask
             mandate,” Docherty said. “We have also learned a lot and grown accustomed to personal
              behaviours that can minimize transmission risk, including virtual meetings and physical 
              distancing. We are confident that we can safely welcome growing numbers of people back to
               campus over the summer and prepare for something closer to normal over the fall and 
               winter.”<br><br>
            
            Under Phase Grey, classes in the Summer term will continue to be taught almost entirely 
            remotely, as previously announced. For the Fall 2021 term, the University is planning to 
            generally welcome classes of up to 25 students, although a small number of larger classes 
            may be taught in person should public health orders permit. This will continue even if the 
            University is able to move into a ‘light grey’ mode, or even into Phase Gold. Plans for the
             Winter 2022 term will be announced in the coming months.<br><br>
            
            The shift to Phase Grey takes effect immediately. More information, including answers to 
            frequently asked questions by faculty, staff, students and regarding the university’s 
            operations and Covid preparations, is being updated on the university’s dedicated website 
            at BrandonU.ca/Covid-19.
